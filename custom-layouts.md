# Suggested Custom Layouts

## Custom 1

Left thumb:

|-----|----|
|Del|Bksp|
|OneShot(Nav layer)|mod_tap(ctrl, tab)|

For the right thumb:

 mod_tap(gui, enter), OneShot(Punct layer), space, RAlt, again, left to right.

On the left hand, I hold the OS(Nav) and have arrows on ESDF (Qwerty). On the right hand, I hold the OS(Punct) for most any symbol I'd need for programming, other than the ones on the shifted num row, but I do put parens on the Punct layer. I also have Nav pointing at Punct and Punct pointing at Nav under the OS key, so I can tap-and-hold the keys to get to the other layer.
