# Suggested Custom Layouts

## Custom 1

Left thumb:

|||
|-----|----|
|Del|Bksp|
|OneShot(Nav layer)|mod_tap(ctrl, tab)|

For the right thumb:

|||
|-----|----|
|mod_tap(gui, enter)| OneShot(Punct layer)|
|space|RAlt|

On the left hand, I hold the OS(Nav) and have arrows on ESDF (Qwerty). On the right hand, I hold the OS(Punct) for most any symbol I'd need for programming,
other than the ones on the shifted num row, but I do put parens on the Punct layer. I also have Nav pointing at Punct and Punct pointing at Nav under the OS key,
so I can tap-and-hold the keys to get to the other layer.

## Custom 2

I can't recommend thumb Shift enough. The primary purpose of Shift is to be used in chords to produce other typing symbols. Your thumb is far and away the best
finger for chording, because it's opposable, which means you can hold down the thumb without restricting the movement of your other fingers in any way whatsoever.
Shift is probably the most frequently-used chording modifier, so it behooves you to place this in the most comfortable position possible.

Since this is my first split, I want something as close to a qwerty.

And that is a mistake. Why did you buy a keyboard that could be so much better than a standard keyboard, and then try to force it into the shape of a standard keyboard?

I promise you it doesn't take much time or effort to adapt to a more radical layout. Don't cripple your amazing new keyboard.
